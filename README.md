Comments:
this assignment need some changes so it can be publish as an official one:
- I noticed some typos in functions like get. it said ,"you have to return null if
the key doesn't exist". get is an int return function so it is no posible to really
return null in a function like that. i will assume return -1 will be a better option
so it doesn't confuse the next student.
- More resources will be helpful for this assignment. maybe in each different programming
language if it is posible or fucus the assignment in an specific language.
